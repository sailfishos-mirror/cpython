Fix the folding of headers by the :mod:`email` library when :rfc:`2047` encoded words are used.  Now whitespace is correctly preserved and also correctly added between adjacent encoded words.  The latter property was broken by the fix for gh-92081, which mostly fixed previous failures to preserve whitespace.
